# JavaScript Playground

The purpose of this project was for me to refresh my knowledge on JavaScript, practice various features of the language, practice programming, and learn. It was also to help me experiment and practice using git.

The website was made with a desktop browser in mind. The CSS is not responsive as that was not a focus.
