# JavaScript Playground

The purpose of this project was for me to refresh my knowledge on JavaScript, practice various features of the language, practice programming, and learn. This project was also to help me experiment and practice using git.

This project was made with a desktop browser in mind. The CSS is not responsive as that was not a focus during this project.
